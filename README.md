Notebooks
=========

I am interested in Finance, Statistics, Computer Science and Maths. The notebooks on here will be related to topics that lie at the intersection of those.

1. [Concepts In Quantitative Finance](https://github.com/martingaleakki/Notebooks/tree/master/Concepts_In_Quantiative_Finance)
2. [Trading Strategies](https://github.com/martingaleakki/Notebooks/tree/master/Trading_Strategies)
3. [Regression Techniques](https://github.com/martingaleakki/Notebooks/tree/master/Regression)
4. [Asset Allocation Models] (https://github.com/martingaleakki/Notebooks/tree/master/Asset_Allocation)
